# Mobile-Document-Scanner

## Statement
You need to make a mobile document scanner for an image. This image will contain a slip or small paper.

## Procedure
We first find the contours that will give us the coordinates of the corners of the desired output. We will use these corners to find the edges and highlight it.
We use OpenCV python, scikit image and pyimagesearch libraries and its functions.
